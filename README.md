# Evaluation
Our test set (vframe_text_1000.txt) contains 1000 clauses extracted from HGC 2.0.4. The clauses are selected according to the following criteria:
- the clause has to contain exactly one finite verb,
- in addition to this, it must have at least one verbal particle OR an infinitive,
- the finite as well as the infinite verb can be a particle verb (thus, they particle is written together with the verb).
